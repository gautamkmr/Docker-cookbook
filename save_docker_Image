#there are two ways to save docker images which can be migrated to another machine

1.  

 docker save -o <save image to path> <image name>

 #Then copy your image to a new system with regular file transfer tools such as cp or scp. 
 #After that you will have to load the image into docker:
 
 docker load -i <path to image tar file>

 #now you are in the same image :)

2.

 # For a flattened export of a container's filesystem, use;

 docker export CONTAINER_ID > my_container.tar

 Use docker import my_container.tar to import said image.
