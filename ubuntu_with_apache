#Get a container
sudo docker run -t -i ubuntu /bin/bash

#install wget you need it
apt-get update
apt-get -f install
apt-get install wget

#Get the tomcat tar file
#if following mirror doesn't work check the page version might have changed
wget mirror.atlanticmetro.net/apache/tomcat/tomcat-7/v7.0.54/bin/apache-tomcat-7.0.54.tar.gz

#Extract it
tar xvzf apache-tomcat-7.0.54.tar.gz

#move to the location you want
# I move to root directory      mv apache-tomcat-7.0.54/   /tomcat7
mv apache-tomcat-7.0.54/  <any_directory>/tomcat7

#remove tar.gz
rm apache-tomcat-7.0.54.tar.gz

#Lets install java now, will come back to tomcat again
sudo apt-get install default-jdk

#update the path of java home in bashrc
sudo vi ~/.bashrc
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
export CATALINA_HOME=~/path/to/tomcat  

#Save the bashrc  and restart it, there is . in the front
. ~/.bashrc

# Update the path of java in tomcat as well
sudo gedit <path to tomcat>/tomcat7/bin/catalina.sh

#add the following lines at the end, version might be different so use your not mine :)
JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/default-java"
JRE_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/jre"

#now lets start the tomcat
$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh

if it runs you are good to go, sometime it might says "touch, can't touch .../logs/catalina.out
This might be the problem related to permission so go ahead create a directory called logs under tomcat7 and create a file catalina.out


using other terminal find the ip address (docker inspect container_id) of your container  and enter following line in your browser
<ip address of container>:8080

it should so show.
It works !




If you want the ubuntu14.04 with tomcat. You can use my image which I have hosted on docker-hub

search for "rgaut/ubuntuwith_tomcat7"
